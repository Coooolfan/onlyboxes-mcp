# Onlyboxes

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Onlyboxes is a self-hosted code execution sandbox platform for individuals and small teams.

It uses a control-plane (`console`) and execution-plane (`worker`) architecture, and exposes both REST APIs and MCP tools.

## Key Features

- Self-hosted all components: control node (`console`) + worker nodes (`worker`)
- Separated control and execution planes:
  - Workers support **horizontal scaling**
  - Workers support multi-language **heterogeneous** implementations
  - Workers support **multiple runtimes**
- Full account system: resource isolation (stateful containers, sessions) between accounts
- MCP tools:
  - `pythonExec`: Python code execution
  - `terminalExec`: stateful terminal sessions
  - `readImage`: model-readable images
- REST API: all MCP tools also available via HTTP + async task API

> [!WARNING]
>
> In the current release, console (gRPC + HTTP) does not provide built-in TLS/mTLS.
>
> `worker` rejects insecure console endpoints by default; plaintext is allowed only when `WORKER_CONSOLE_INSECURE=true` is explicitly set.
>
> Put both console HTTP (`:8089`) and gRPC (`:50051`) endpoints behind your reverse proxy/gateway and enforce TLS for external traffic.

## Architecture

## Quick Start (Self-Hosted)

### 1) Prerequisites

- Control node:
  - Docker Engine (no dependencies if deployed via Docker)
- Worker node:
  - Docker Engine (required by `worker-docker`)

### 2) Start the console service

1. Download the `docker-compose.yml` file:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p onlyboxes-console && cd onlyboxes-console
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Coooolfan/onlyboxes/refs/heads/main/docker/docker-compose.yml

    ```

2. Edit `docker-compose.yml` and replace at least:
   - `CONSOLE_HASH_KEY`
   - `CONSOLE_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`
3. Start console:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

Default endpoints:

- Console Web UI / HTTP REST API / MCP endpoint: `http://127.0.0.1:8089`
- gRPC: `127.0.0.1:50051`

### 3) Sign in and create an access token

- Open `http://127.0.0.1:8089` in your browser.
- Sign in with the initialized admin account.
![Console login page](static/docs/quickstart-login.png)
- Go to the token management page and create an access token.
![Token created dialog (one-time plaintext token)](static/docs/quickstart-token-modal.png)
- Save the plaintext token immediately (it is returned only once).

### 4) Create a worker identity in dashboard

- Go to Workers page and create a worker.
![Workers page](static/docs/quickstart-workers-page.png)
- Copy and securely store the startup command from the creation dialog (`WORKER_SECRET` is one-time visible).
![Worker created dialog (startup command and one-time secret)](static/docs/quickstart-worker-created-modal.png)

### 5) Run worker

> [!WARNING]
> Workers support different runtimes and environments. The current release only provides `worker-docker`. This section uses the Docker runtime as an example.

1. Log in to the machine where the worker will be deployed.
    - Ensure Docker Engine is installed.
    - Ensure the worker can reach the console gRPC endpoint.
2. Download the latest `worker-docker` binary from GitHub Releases:
    - `https://github.com/onlyboxes/onlyboxes/releases/latest`
3. Use the startup command values from the dashboard, and replace the binary path with your downloaded executable.
    - Workers reject insecure console endpoints by default; set `WORKER_CONSOLE_INSECURE=true` only to allow plaintext connections.

    ```bash
    # Example
    WORKER_CONSOLE_INSECURE=true \
    WORKER_CONSOLE_GRPC_TARGET=127.0.0.1:50051 \
    WORKER_ID=<worker_id> \
    WORKER_SECRET=<worker_secret> \
    ./onlyboxes-worker-docker
    ```

### 6) Verify readiness

- Confirm the worker is `online` on the dashboard Workers page.
- For REST API request examples, see `API.md`.
- If no tokens are configured, `/mcp` and execution APIs return `401` by design.
- Add the MCP endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8089/mcp` in any LLM Chat Client, set the token, and verify it works correctly.

## Production Checklist

- Replace all default credentials.
- Use a reverse proxy to enforce TLS for `:8089` and `:50051`.
- Persist and back up the SQLite data directory (`CONSOLE_DB_PATH`).
- Run workers on isolated hosts to avoid sharing the Docker daemon with the console.
- Read the `Configuration Reference` below for all available options and adjust as needed.

## Configuration Reference

### Console (`console`)

| Environment Variable | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CONSOLE_HTTP_ADDR` | `:8089` | Dashboard + REST API listen address |

| `WORKER_SECRET` | _(required)_ | Issued once by `POST /api/v1/workers` |
| `WORKER_CONSOLE_GRPC_TARGET` | `127.0.0.1:50051` | Console gRPC target |
| `WORKER_CONSOLE_INSECURE` | `false` | `false` enforces TLS endpoint; set `true` only to allow plaintext console gRPC |

## API Surfaces

- Dashboard auth: `/api/v1/console/*`
- Worker management (admin): `/api/v1/workers*`
- Command execution: `/api/v1/commands/echo`, `/api/v1/commands/terminal`
- Task execution: `/api/v1/tasks*`
- MCP (Streamable HTTP): `POST /mcp`

## Development

### Run backend from source

```bash
cd console
CONSOLE_HASH_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32) go run ./cmd/console
```

### Run web dev server

```bash
yarn --cwd web install
yarn --cwd web dev
```

Web dev URL defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:5178` and proxies `/api/*` to `http://127.0.0.1:8089`.

### Useful docs

- Unified API reference: `API.md`
- Console internals: `console/README/overview.md`
- Worker internals: `worker/worker-docker/README/overview.md`
- API/proto guide: `api/README/proto.md`
- Web app guide: `web/README.md`

## Release & Images

- GitHub workflow: `.github/workflows/package-release.yml`
- Console Docker image: `coolfan1024/onlyboxes:<version>` and `coolfan1024/onlyboxes:latest`
- Console binary includes embedded web assets

## Security and Operational Notes

- Console does not provide built-in TLS/mTLS in this release; `worker-docker` requires explicit `WORKER_CONSOLE_INSECURE=true` to connect over plaintext.
- Put console HTTP (`:8089`) and gRPC (`:50051`) behind a reverse proxy/gateway and enforce TLS on public/external links.
- `WORKER_SECRET` and access token plaintext values are returned only at creation time.
- Dashboard login sessions are in-memory and are invalidated when `console` restarts.
