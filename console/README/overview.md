# Console Overview

The console service hosts:
- a gRPC registry endpoint with bidirectional stream `Connect` for worker registration + heartbeat + command dispatch/result.
- embedded web dashboard static hosting:
  - `GET /` serves embedded `web` frontend.
  - `GET /assets/*` serves bundled static assets.
  - non-API `GET/HEAD` routes use SPA fallback (`index.html`).
  - `/api/*` and `/mcp` are excluded from SPA fallback.
- REST APIs for worker data (dashboard, authentication required):
  - `GET /api/v1/workers` for paginated worker listing.
  - `GET /api/v1/workers/stats` for aggregated worker status metrics.
  - `POST /api/v1/workers` for creating a provisioned worker (`worker_id` + `worker_secret`) and returning its startup command.
  - `DELETE /api/v1/workers/:node_id` for deleting a provisioned worker and revoking its credential (online worker is disconnected immediately).
  - `GET /api/v1/workers/:node_id/startup-command` for on-demand copy of a worker startup command (includes `WORKER_ID` + `WORKER_SECRET` in command text only).
- command APIs (execution, token whitelist required):
  - `POST /api/v1/commands/echo` for blocking echo command execution.
  - `POST /api/v1/commands/terminal` for blocking terminal command execution over `terminalExec` capability.
  - `POST /api/v1/tasks` for sync/async/auto task submission.
  - `GET /api/v1/tasks/:task_id` for task status and result lookup.
  - `POST /api/v1/tasks/:task_id/cancel` for best-effort task cancellation.
  - request header: `X-Onlyboxes-Token: <token>` (must be in whitelist).
  - token isolation: each token is treated as an isolated user boundary for task/session resources.
  - task visibility: task lookup/cancel is owner-scoped by token; cross-token access returns `404`.
  - task idempotency: `request_id` de-duplication is scoped per token (same `request_id` across different tokens does not conflict).
- MCP Streamable HTTP API (token whitelist required):
  - `POST /mcp` for JSON-RPC requests over Streamable HTTP transport.
  - request header: `X-Onlyboxes-Token: <token>` (must be in whitelist).
  - if whitelist is empty (no tokens configured in dashboard), all `/mcp` requests are rejected with `401`.
  - `GET /mcp` is intentionally unsupported and returns `405` with `Allow: POST`.
  - stream behavior is JSON response only (`application/json`), no SSE streaming channel.
  - tool argument validation is strict (`additionalProperties=false`): unknown input fields are rejected with JSON-RPC `invalid params (-32602)`.
  - exposed tools:
    - `echo`
      - input: `{"message":"...","timeout_ms":5000}`
      - `message` is required (whitespace-only is rejected).
      - `timeout_ms` is optional, range `1..60000`, default `5000`.
      - output: `{"message":"..."}`
    - `pythonExec`
      - input: `{"code":"print(1)","timeout_ms":60000}`
      - `code` is required (whitespace-only is rejected).
      - `timeout_ms` is optional, range `1..600000`, default `60000`.
      - output: `{"output":"...","stderr":"...","exit_code":0}`
      - non-zero `exit_code` is returned as normal tool output, not as MCP protocol error.
    - `terminalExec`
      - input: `{"command":"pwd","session_id":"optional","create_if_missing":false,"lease_ttl_sec":60,"timeout_ms":60000}`
      - `command` is required (whitespace-only is rejected).
      - `session_id` is optional; omit to create a new terminal session/container.
      - `create_if_missing` controls behavior when `session_id` does not exist.
      - session isolation: returned `session_id` can only be reused by the same token; cross-token use returns `session_not_found`.
      - `lease_ttl_sec` is optional and validated by worker-side lease bounds.
      - `timeout_ms` is optional, range `1..600000`, default `60000`.
      - output: `{"session_id":"...","created":true,"stdout":"...","stderr":"...","exit_code":0,"stdout_truncated":false,"stderr_truncated":false,"lease_expires_unix_ms":...}`
    - `readImage`
      - input: `{"session_id":"required","file_path":"required","timeout_ms":60000}`
      - `session_id` and `file_path` are required (whitespace-only is rejected).
      - validates file existence via worker `terminalResource` capability; directories are rejected.
      - output is content-only (no structured output fields).
      - image files (`image/*`) return exactly one `image` content item.
      - non-image files return exactly one `text` content item:
        - `unsupported mime type: <mime>; expected image/*`
      - non-format failures (session/file missing, busy, timeout, read failure) are returned as tool errors.
- dashboard authentication APIs:
  - `POST /api/v1/console/login` with `{"username":"...","password":"..."}`.
  - `POST /api/v1/console/logout`.
  - token management (requires dashboard auth):
    - `GET /api/v1/console/tokens` list token metadata (`id`, `name`, masked token).
    - `POST /api/v1/console/tokens` create token (manual token or auto-generated).
    - `GET /api/v1/console/tokens/:token_id/value` fetch token plaintext by id.
    - `DELETE /api/v1/console/tokens/:token_id` delete token.

Credential behavior:
- `console` starts with `0` workers.
- worker credentials are generated on demand by dashboard/API `POST /api/v1/workers`.
- credentials are in-memory only; restarting `console` clears all provisioned workers/credentials.
- deleting a provisioned worker revokes the credential immediately; if the worker is online, its current session is closed.

Defaults:
- HTTP: `:8089`
- gRPC: `:50051`
- Replay window: `60s`
- Heartbeat interval: `5s`

Dashboard credential behavior:
- startup resolves dashboard credentials and logs them to stdout.
- username env: `CONSOLE_DASHBOARD_USERNAME`
- password env: `CONSOLE_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`
- if either env var is missing, only the missing value is randomly generated.

Trusted token behavior:
- tokens are in-memory only and managed by dashboard APIs.
- token metadata includes `name` (case-insensitive unique) and token value.
- if token list is empty, MCP and execution APIs are effectively disabled (`401`).
- every accepted token is treated as a distinct user for task and terminal-session ownership.
- task and session resources are isolated across tokens (`task not found` / `session_not_found` on cross-token access).
- `request_id` idempotency keys are isolated per token.
